Welcome!
This Python script pulls data from Amazon reviews and creates a list ranking the words by popularity.
As Books.jsonl, the file chosen, is 20 GB big, it can take 15-30 minutes to finish the entire script.
To create the link for "url" in the if name == main part, follow these steps:
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/datasets/McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023/blob/main/raw/review_categories/Books.jsonl.
2. Click "download".
3. Copy the URL it leads to.
4. Replace the contents of the "url" variable with the link.
   Note: The link will expire, so be quick!
